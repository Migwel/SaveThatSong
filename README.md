# Save that Song! 

This project is about saving songs that are currently playing on specified inputs.

My goal is to initially support the following inputs:
* Sonos
* Radio (Icecast)

And to initially support the following actions:
* Save to Spotify

Thus, if a nice song is playing on your Sonos or on your radio, you would be able to make an API call to Save that Song!
and it will automatically add it to your Spotify Liked songs.

# Status

This is the initial commit so not much is done (even though I already have another repo doing basically the same thing).
My goal is to get the API up and running and working with a single user (myself) quite fast. Once it's done, I'll
add user management to allow for this service to be used by multiple users.

Once it's done, I'll invest in a nice (?) UI where configuring inputs and actions should be easier.

Finally, I'll need to think about whether other inputs or actions could be added, all suggestions are welcome (open an issue with your idea)
